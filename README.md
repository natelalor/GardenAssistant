### Tech Stack
- Front End: React integrated with AJAX/Axios for HTTP requests.
- Back End: Python API utilizing Flask with a SQL database, including SQLAlchemy for SQL adaptation and CORS for smooth HTTP interactions.

### Process
This is a project I embarked on for a few specific reasons. First, I wanted to get more familiarity with the React framework, as well as javascript syntax. Further, I wanted to
brush up on my Flask and SQL backend knowledge, specifically efficient and effective integration. Lastly, who doesn't love to implement Python APIs!

The SQL database holds the vegetable growth and spacial requirements, where object-oriented python programming is used in an Agile development cycle with CI/CD for clean, safe, and scalable code. Jira was utilized to provide project management and track development progression.
