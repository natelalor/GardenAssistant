## Garden Assistant
So you want to make a garden, but you aren't sure where to start. **Great!** Garden Assistant is a website where you can include some aspects of the garden you know you want, 
and it will do the rest. Utilizing **row-based optimization algorithms**, it will use the aspects of the garden you need and will design your garden in the most efficient layout.

### Tech Stack
- Front End: React integrated with Axios for HTTP requests.
- Back End: Python API utilizing Flask with a SQL database, including SQLAlchemy for SQL adaptation and CORS for HTTP interactions.

### Process
This is a project I embarked on for a few specific reasons. First, I wanted to get more familiarity with the React framework, as well as javascript syntax. Further, I wanted to
brush up on my Flask and SQL backend knowledge, and implementing that in an efficient and effective way. Lastly, who doesn't love to implement Python APIs!
